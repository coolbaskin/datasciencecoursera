These tests are copied from ...\Project.Learning.Computing_For_Data_Analysis\Week_2\Quiz\ which is the original place
this code was written in. The original submission format was to run the scripts locally using <script_name>-test.R 
scripts and then upload them to Coursera manually. Therefore <script_name>-tesoutput<number>.txt files contain the 
correct output for these scripts and can be used as tests if any changes are implemented to these scripts.
